      #### 3.3.2The Role of Mind Map

      ![](./Oppie-Agentic-Reasoning-main/images/agentic_reasoning_fig_4.png)

      Figure 4: A tricky question that misleads most LLMs is correctly answered by us.

      We fnd that Mind Maps are particularly effec tive in clarifying complex logical relationships, en abling the model to solve problems that often mis lead traditional LLMs. We highlight two key cases where Mind Mapping maximizes its capabilities:

      First, Mind Maps help correctly answer tricky logic-based questions that frequently fool LLMs. A well-known example is a modifed riddle: "The sur geon, who is the boy's father, says 'I can't operate on this child, he's my son!' Who is the surgeon to the boy?" DeepSeek-R1 took 17 seconds to process this question but still produced the wrong answer, a failure also observed in models from the GPT and Gemini series models. These models often fall for a political-correct corpus contaminated response,failing to recognize the obvious logical structure.However, in our Agentic Reasoning framework, the use of a Mind Map allows the model to explicitly analyze the logical relationships between the enti ties [surgeon], [boy], and [father], leading to the correct answer.

      Second, Mind Maps enhance deductive reason ing in strategic games. We test our approach in Werewolf, a classic social deduction game where players take on hidden roles as either villagers or werewolves. Villagers attempt to identify the were wolves, while werewolves deceive the group and eliminate players without being caught. The game alternates between "night", where werewolves se cretly attack, and "day", where players debate and vote on eliminations.To evaluate our Agentic Reasoning model, we invited seven experienced Werewolf players (5+ years of experience) to play against it. The model achieved an impressive 72%win rate, signifcantly exceeding both the expected statistical win rate and the performance of human players in our experiment.

      We analyzed the Mind Maps generated by the Agentic Reasoning model over multiple rounds of play, as shown in Figure 5. These visual structures helped the model track the relationships between different players based on their spoken arguments,allowing it to more accurately identify deception strategies, anticipate voting behaviors, and opti mize its own disguise tactics. This result demon strates that Mind Mapping is not just a tool for logic puzzles but also a powerful strategy enhancer in dynamic reasoning environments.

### Below is the **Playbook** in English, summarizing the same step-by-step approach for **reverse engineering** and **repackaging** the Guangbiao IDE `.AppImage`, under the explicit authorization granted by Anysphere Inc. for **internal Security Red Team** purposes.

---

#### 1. Preparation


1. **Operating Environment**  
   - Ubuntu 22.04 LTS with `libfuse2` installed.  
   - Recommended internal or isolated network environment.  
   - Sudo privileges for mounting and extracting the `.AppImage`.

3. **Tools & Dependencies**  
   - **For AppImage**: `libfuse2`, optional: `appimagetool`, `AppImageKit`.  
   - **Unpacking & Debugging**:  
     - `asar` (`npm install -g asar`)  
     - `strings`, `file`, `ltrace`, `strace`, `gdb`, etc.  
   - **Node/Electron Build**: Node.js + npm/yarn, plus an editor (VS Code).  

---

#### 2. High-Level Reverse Engineering Workflow

1. **Obtain the Guangbiao IDE `.AppImage`**  
2. **Extract the AppImage** to get the `squashfs-root` filesystem  
3. **Identify Electron resources** (`.asar` files)  
4. **Unpack `.asar`** files for front-end & back-end scripts  
5. **Set up debugging** to inspect runtime behavior (DevTools, Node inspector)  
6. **Identify security risks** (local privilege escalations, AI model misuse, etc.)  
7. **Make authorized modifications** (e.g., instrument code to log suspicious activity)  
8. **Rebuild & repackage** as AppImage or run from local folder  

---

#### 3. AppImage Extraction & Structure Analysis

1. **Add Execute Permission**  
   ```bash
   chmod +x Guangbiao-IDE.AppImage
   ```

2. **Use `--appimage-extract`**  
   ```bash
   ./Guangbiao-IDE.AppImage --appimage-extract
   ```
   - Creates a `squashfs-root` folder containing the unpacked filesystem.




4. **Typical Folder Structure**  
   - `package.json` / `package-lock.json`: Node dependencies.  
   - `main.js` or `index.js`: Electron main process entry.  
   - `src/` or `dist/`: UI/React/TypeScript logic for the renderer process.  
   - Other crucial modules: AI-driven code generation logic, the "Composer" UI, agent tooling, etc.

---

#### 5. Security Research & Debugging Techniques

1. **Local Execution & DevTools**  
   - If the unpacked app is runnable (has `package.json`):
     ```bash
     cd app_unpacked
     npm install
     npm start
     ```
   - Press `Ctrl+Shift+I` or `F12` to open Chrome DevTools for front-end debugging.  
   - Use `--inspect=9229` to attach a Node debugger for the main process.

2. **Dynamic Analysis (strace / ltrace)**  
   - Example:
     ```bash
     strace -f -o strace.log npm start
     ```
   - Logs system calls to identify suspicious operations.  
   - `ltrace` for library calls (especially if native modules are present).

3. **Focus on Potential Vulnerabilities**  
   - **Credentials or Keys**: Check for hardcoded secrets, tokens, or credentials.  
   - **AI Context Handling**: Evaluate risk of private data leaking into AI prompts.  
   - **Agent Mode**: Potential local command execution or privilege escalation.  
   - **Electron Sandbox**: Validate secure defaults, e.g., `nodeIntegration=false`.

---

#### 6. Modifying Guangbiao & Rebuilding

1. **Local Modifications**  
   - In `app_unpacked`, tweak UI or instrumentation code.  
   - If new packages are needed, update `package.json` and run `npm install`.


3. **Recreate the AppImage**  
   - Ensure that all other files in `squashfs-root` remain intact.  
   - Install `appimagetool`:
     ```bash
     sudo apt-get install appimagetool
     ```
   - From the `squashfs-root` folder:
     ```bash
     cd squashfs-root
     appimagetool . ../Guangbiao-IDE-RedTeam.AppImage
     ```
   - Once built, `chmod +x` on `Guangbiao-IDE-RedTeam.AppImage` and run locally.

4. **Important Note**  
   - Keep version control (e.g., Git) for each iteration.  
---

### 7. Additional Recommendations & Risk Control

1. **Isolated Environments**  
   - Use a Docker container or VM to prevent cross-contamination and ensure easier teardown.
